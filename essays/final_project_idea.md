<h1>Final Project Idea</h1>
October 31 2023
<hr>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Many UH students start small businesses while in school, whether it be to cover financial costs or to pursue an entrepreneurial dream they have. However, it is very difficult to get a small business off the ground and many fail pretty early on. Therefore, to promote ones small business and to search for a client base for your specific goods or service locally on campus, I propose <i>"ManoaBiz"</i>, which is an app that would let students post about their businesses. They could give quick introductions on what they provide and use links to their own websites to provide more information.
</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
  A student will be able to create a profile for there own business after they create an account and log in. The page to edit their business profile will only be available to them. The general application permissions everyone has allows them to view other businesses on a main hub (similar to the github.io portfolios). Then, they can bookmark a business they have interest in to save it to a bookmarked tab. This will be how my appliation utilizes meteor databases. 

  Some potential pages of the application would be: 
  <ul>
    <li>Landing Page</li>
    <li>Sign In Page</li>
    <li>Student Businesses Page (Home)</li>
    <li>Bookmarked Businesses</li>
    <li>Edit My Business Profile Page</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Use Case Ideas</h3>
<p>For the use cases you are going to log in as both a user and administrator always. You will always be an administrator on your own business profile, but you can choose whether to edit it or even post it to the main hub. However, everyone has user permissions and can browse and bookmark other businesses. A user can browse the main hub and click on a business to be redirected to that businesses page which has basic information, contact info, and maybe a link to their own websites.</p>

<h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>
<p>The idea of being able to bookmark and edit your business profile is they beyond the basic ideas of this application since it involves making a change on the client side and having it updated on the server side. Also after these actions are taken, the individual users web app will look different than everyone elses since they are the only ones with access to the edit page and only they see their bookmarks.</p>
